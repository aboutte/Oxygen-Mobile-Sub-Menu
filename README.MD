This plugin allows you to add sub menu toggle functionality to your site created in [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/).

See [demo](https://demo.wplit.com/oxygen-mobile-menu/).

(designed as a temporary solution until something similar is added to Oxygen, if that happens... just uninstall this plugin before updating to the next Oxygen version)

There are no settings or setup. It is intentionally simple, allowing you to style the sub menu as you want from inside the Oxygen UI.

For general info on setting up menus in Oxygen, refer to the [offical documentation](https://oxygenbuilder.com/documentation/builder-elements/menu/).
 

## Installation ##

1. [Download the plugin here.](https://github.com/wplit/Oxygen-Mobile-Sub-Menu/archive/master.zip)
2. Go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress admin. Click on `Upload Plugin` and browse for the zip file.
3. Activate the plugin. There are no settings.

## Usage ##

### To activate sub menus in your mobile responsive menu

1. Ensure you have enabled dropdowns in the primary menu settings.
2. Ensure you have 'Include dropdowns links in the responsive menu' checked also.
3. Inside the Oxygen builder you should see all menu items, top level and sub menus.
4. To style sub menu items just for mobiles, you can select them using the selector detector and use Oxygen UI to style. Be sure you have the ID of the menu and the class 'oxy-nav-menu-open' selected to override (see image below for example)

Note: You won't see the menu toggle buttons inside the Oxygen builder. Use the builder just to style the menus as you need. The toggle buttons will automatically appear on the front end of your site.
